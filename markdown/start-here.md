# start here

Welcome to the Binder documentation site! Binder is a collection of tools for building and executing version-controlled computational environments that contain code, data, and interactive front ends. Before you dive in, here's a quick overview of how this site is organized.

## users

If you're new to the project, or want to immediately start creating executable environments from your code and data using our public cluster, then check out the *users* section. It explains what Binder is and how you can start using it, and answers frequently asked questions, including a roadmap of our future plans. You should also check out the *examples* section (under *modules*), which contains example repositories covering various dependency formats.

If you're already using Binder but having trouble, come join us in the [chatroom](https://gitter.im/binder-project/binder), or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/binder-project/binder).

## devs

If you'd like to deploy your own custom instance of Binder, or you'd like to start fixing bugs or adding features, then check out the *devs* and *modules* sections. In the *devs* section, we go into more detail about how Binder works, describe the different ways to configure and deploy a cluster, and provide the complete HTTP API. The *modules* section just contains the README's for all of the independent modules that make up Binder, to make it easier to browse and read them all in one place.
