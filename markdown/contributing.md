# contributing

Binder is 100% open-source and is licensed under the MIT license, so it's free to be used however
you like. We're always eager to have new contributors join the project, and there are plenty of
places to jump in! 

Take a look at the [FAQ](TODO: link) page to see a rough outline of our roadmap for the next few 
months - those are the problems that we're currently tackling. We'd love to be able to expand the 
number of issues we can take on at once, and there are far more issues in our GitHub 
[issue tracker](TODO: link) than there are on our roadmap, so feel free to bite off any one of
those!

If have any suggestions, open an issue in the issue tracker, or jump into our Gitter
[chatroom](TODO: link) and speak your mind! Do the same if you're looking for advice on where to
start contributing.
