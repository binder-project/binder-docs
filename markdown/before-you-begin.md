### before you begin

Welcome to the Binder documentation site! Before you dive in, here's a quick overview of how we've
decided to split up the documentation: 

#### users
If you're new to the project, or you just want to start creating some executable environments out of
your code/data, then the __users__ section is the right place for you! There you'll find an
explanation of what Binder is, how you can start using it, and answers to frequently asked questions
(including a roadmap of our future plans).

If you've already started using Binder, but you're having some trouble, check out the __examples__ 
section (under __modules__) for some example Binder-compatible repositories covering all supported
dependency files.

We definitely encourage everyone to jump into our Gitter
[chatroom](https://gitter.im/binder-project/binder?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) if you encounter problems that aren't covered by the examples, or if you just want to
say hey.

#### devs
If you'd like to deploy your own custom instance of Binder, or you'd like to start fixing bugs or
adding features, then check out the __devs__ and __modules__ sections. 

In the __devs__ section, we go into more detail about how Binder works, describe the different ways to
set up a custom cluster, and provide the HTTP API.

The __modules__ section just contains the GitHub README's for all of Binder's modules, copied into
one place for convenience.
