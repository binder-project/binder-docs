### before you begin

Welcome to the Binder documentation site! Before you dive in, here's a quick overview of how we've decided to split up the docs: 

#### users
If you're new to the project, or you just want to start creating some executable environments out of your code/data, then the **users** section is the right place for you! There you'll find an explanation of what Binder is, how you can start using it, and answers to frequently asked questions (including a roadmap of our future plans).

If you've already started using Binder, but you're having some trouble, check out the **examples** section (under **modules**) for some example Binder-compatible repositories covering all supported dependency files.

We definitely encourage everyone to jump into our 
[chatroom](https://gitter.im/binder-project/binder) if you encounter problems that aren't covered by the examples, or if you just want to say hi.

#### devs
If you'd like to deploy your own custom instance of Binder, or you'd like to start fixing bugs or adding features, then check out the **devs** and **modules** sections. 

In the **devs** section, we go into more detail about how Binder works, describe the different ways to set up a custom cluster, and provide the HTTP API.

The **modules** section just contains the GitHub README's for all of Binder's modules, copied into one place for convenience.
