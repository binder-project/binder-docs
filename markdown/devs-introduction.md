# introduction

Introduction for developers.

The `binder-control`
[README](https://github.com/binder-project/binder-control/blob/master/README.md) file contains
step-by-step instructions for provisioning a machine with all the necessary prerequisites, setting
up a Kubernetes cluster and starting the Binder servers.

The simplest way to do this is through the
[`binder-control`](https://github.com/binder-project/binder-control) module, which wraps all other
server-side Binder services and provides an interactive CLI tool for starting/stopping them.
