Version control and social coding sites like GitHub make it simple to share code, and projects like the Jupyter notebook provide interactive interfaces for language-agnostic analysis. But executing that code remains a hurdle â€” dependencies, data, and system configuration are less portable than code, and are more difficult to specify. Binder has two primary goals: to make it easy to construct reproducible environments, even without knowledge of containerization technology; and to make these environments available for instantaneous deployment in the browser.

A public Binder cluster is hosted at [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org) and supported by HHMI [Janelia](http://janelia.org). It lets anyone build and deploy computational environments, and currently hosts more than 1000 builds. Binder itself is 100% open source software, and we've tried to make it as easy as possible for others to deploy their own version of a Binder cluster.

If you just want to share your code by building a Binder on the public cluster, continue reading the *getting started* section, or just head over to [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org) and try it out! If you run into trouble at any point, you can come find us in the [chatroom](https://gitter.im/binder-project) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/binder-project/binder)
